# Push Swap Tester

**Push Swap Tester** is a Bash script designed to test the reliability, performance, and memory management of the **Push Swap** program. It includes validity checks, performance benchmarking, and memory leak detection using `valgrind`.

## üéØ Purpose

This script evaluates:

1. **Result Validity**: Verifies if the `push_swap` program produces correct solutions for various sets of random numbers.
2. **Performance**: Measures the number of moves generated by `push_swap` to solve permutations.
3. **Memory Management**: Detects memory leaks or other issues using `valgrind`.

---

## üöÄ Usage

### Prerequisites

-   `bash`
-   `valgrind`
-   `curl` (for automatic downloading of the `checker` file, if needed)

### Running the Script

Run with curl:

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Zak4b/push_swap_tester/refs/heads/main/push_swap_tester.sh | bash
```

or clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Zak4b/push_swap_tester.git
cd push_swap_tester
./push_swap_tester.sh PUSH_SWAP
```

-   **PUSH_SWAP**: Path to your `push_swap` executable (default: `./push_swap`).

## üõ†Ô∏è Features

### Included Tests

1. **Memory Tests (`push_swap_memtest`)**

    - Verifies that your program:
        - Has no memory leaks.
        - Properly handles invalid inputs, duplicate arguments, etc.

2. **No Output Test (`push_swap_nooutput`)**

    - Ensures that `push_swap` produces no output when no actions are required.

3. **Correctness Tests (`push_swap_test`)**

    - Tests various input cases to ensure the solution is valid when validated with the `checker` program.

4. **Performance Benchmarking (`push_swap_bench`)**
    - Measures the number of moves generated by `push_swap` for solving lists of size 5, 100, or 500.
    - Outputs the minimum, average, and maximum number of moves during the benchmark.
